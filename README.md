# Morse

Morse is the [example](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial) used in showing how to build a library and use it with Arduino.

# Setup/Installation

First, [download](https://github.com/geetarista/Morse-Arduino/downloads) the code.

Next, move the Morse folder that includes `Morse.h` and `Morse.cpp` into `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`.

You can now open up the Arduino IDE and import the library by selecting Sketch > Import Library... > Morse.

Now you can copy in the example SOS sketch and upload it.
